We are please to let you know that we now have a new version of this test
=======
Here in the master branch we merge in all the other dev branches (except the private one)

so it is worth knowing:

== to reset the logs for a branch ==
git reset --soft $(git log --pretty=format:'%H'|tail -n1)
git commit --amend

That resets the logs but with the --soft it does not touch the files in this branch.

You might have to do one more commit after that.
