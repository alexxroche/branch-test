This is the public master branch.

I'm uploading this branch of this repo to see if other branches are also uploaded.

git remote add origin git@github.com:alexxroche/branch-test.git
git push -v origin master

... and there is another branch called private, but you do not get that with:

git clone git://github.com/alexxroche/branch-test.git

(hardly surprising as the 'remote add' and push used master)


This way you can create a local branch and it is not pushed out to github.
